# Mapping The Matrix
## Background
Have you ever wondered how youâ€™re computer takes you to google.com or facebook.com?

Many users are unaware that the internet is made up of physical connections and when you visit a website you first visit many other locations before your final destination.

Mapping The Matrix is a project that visualizes your IP packet through the physical world until you arrive to your end destination (i.e google.com, facebook.com). Along the way, the user may see information about the city they're packet has visited as well as some IP information.

Wake up from the Matrix!
