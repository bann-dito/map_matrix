# Mapping The Matrix ðŸ’»
## Background
Have you ever wondered how youâ€™re computer takes you to google.com or facebook.com?
Many users are unaware that the internet is made up of physical connections and when you visit a website you first visit many other locations before your final destination.

Mapping The Matrix is a project that visualizes your IP packet through the physical world until you arrive to your end destination (i.e google.com, facebook.com).
1. Click on the Get Start button
2. Enter a domain name (i.e google.com, facebook.com, tesla.com, etc.)
3. Click on the Lets go button
4. Check out the cities your packet has visited
5. Click Next
6. Check out the summary all the places your packet visited!
